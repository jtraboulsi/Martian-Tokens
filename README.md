# Martian-Tokens

![alt text](https://github.com/[jtraboulsi]/[Martian-Tokens]/blob/[main]/application-image.PNG)

## Summary
I built a ERC-20 compliant fungible token that will act a currency for an eventual Mars colony. I also built a Crowdsale contract in Solidity in order to enable those moving to Mars to exchange their earthling money for Kasei.

## Technology
This project required Advance Solidity skills. 

Imported libraries from OpenZeppelin into Solidity.
